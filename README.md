This is a basic php program that uses MySQL to navigate between pages

After running the login page and logging in, you will be sent to the home page.
Here you will see the header home page and a couple pictures of cars. To proceed, click one of the pictures.
On the car detail page you will see the car you clicked on along with a few details to support the car that are pulled from a database.

NOTE on all coding pages, the creation of the databases and tables are commented out as I no longer needed them
